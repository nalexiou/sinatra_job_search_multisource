Please run this Sinatra application on your local machine. Due to multiple http requests,
hosting this application on a server requires a significant amount of temporary resources
that can become expensive.

To run:

1. Clone repository on you machine
2. Run command "bundle install"
3. Run command: "ruby app.rb"

The steps above assume that you have Ruby on your machine.
